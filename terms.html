      <h1>BlowOutGoOut Terms of Service</h1>
      <h5>Effective January 2, 2018</h5>
      <p>These terms of service constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and BlowOutGoOut, LLC. (“BlowOutGoOut,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”) governing your use of the BlowOutGoOut application, website, and technology platform (collectively known as, the “BlowOutGoOut Platform”).</p>
      <p>By entering into to this agreement, you expressly acknowledge that you understand this agreement and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE BlowOutGoOut PLATFORM.</p>
      <p>1. The BlowOutGoOut platform</p>
      <p>The BlowOutGoOut platform provides an app based technology where persons who seek blowout services at certain destinations (“users”) can be matched with stylists providing blowout services at those destinations (“stylist”). Users and stylists are collectively referred to herein as “Users,” and each User shall create a User account that enables access to the BlowOutGoOut platform. For purposes of this Agreement, the blowout services provided by Stylists to users that are matched through the platform shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”. Any decision by a user to offer or accept services is a decision made in such user’s sole discretion. Each blowout service provided by a stylist to a user shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons.</p>
      <p>2. Modification to the agreement</p>
      <p>In the event BlowOutGoOut modifies the terms and conditions of this agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified agreement. BlowOutGoOut reserves the right to modify any information referenced in the hyperlinks from this agreement from time to time, and such modifications shall become effective upon posting. Continued use of the BlowOutGoOut platform or services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. </p>
      <p>3. Eligibility</p>
      <p>The BlowOutGoOut platform may only be used by individuals who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. The BlowOutGoOut platform is not available to children (persons under the age of 18) or users who have had their user account temporarily or permanently deactivated. By becoming a user, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of this agreement. You may not allow other persons to use your user account, and you agree that you are the sole authorized user of your account.</p>
      <p>4. Charges</p>
      <p>As a user, you agree to pay the amounts charged for your use of the BlowOutGoOut platform and services (“Charges”). Charges include service fees and other applicable fees such as parking, surcharges, and taxes, plus any tips to the stylists that you elect to pay. BlowOutGoOut has the authority and reserves the right to determine and modify pricing by posting applicable pricing terms on its website and application for mobile devices. Pricing may vary based on the type of service you request (e.g., Bogo Styles, Bogo Plus). You are responsible for reviewing the applicable BlowOutGoOut web and/or app pages and shall be responsible for all charges incurred under your user account.</p>
      <p>Fees and Other Charges.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Service Fee.</strong> BlowOutGoOut may assess a  “Service Fee” to support the BlowOutGoOut platform and related services provided to you by BlowOutGoOut. The amount of the Service Fee may vary but shall be retained by BlowOutGoOut in its entirety.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Cancellation Fee.</strong> After requesting a service appointment you may cancel it through the app, but note that in certain cases a cancellation fee will apply. Please check out our FAQ’s page on our website. To learn more about BlowOutGoOut’s cancellation policy, contact our <a href="mailto:support@blowoutgoout.com?subject=Cancellation%20Fee&#x27;s">support team</a>. Collected cancellation fees will be passed in their entirety to the stylist who had accepted your service request.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Parking Fee.</strong> In some instances parking fee’s may apply to your service.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Tips. </strong>Following a service appointment, you may elect to tip your stylist in cash or through the mobile application. Any tips will be provided entirely to the applicable stylist.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Facilitation of Charges. </strong>All Charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processing service (Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc.). BlowOutGoOut may replace its third-party payment processing services without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the BlowOutGoOut platform. With the exception of tips, cash payments are strictly prohibited.</p>
      <p> • <strong>No Refunds. </strong> All Charges are non-refundable. This no-refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the BlowOutGoOut platform, any disruption to the BlowOutGoOut platform or services, or any other reason whatsoever.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Credits and Service Discounts. </strong> You may receive credits (&quot;BlowOut credits&quot;) or service discounts (&quot;service discounts&quot;) that you can apply toward payment of certain Charges upon completion of a service appointment. BlowOutGoOut Credits and discounts are only valid for use on the BlowOutGoOut platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. BlowOutGoOut credits and discounts cannot be combined, and if the cost of your service exceeds the applicable credit or discount value we will charge your payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the service. Discounts only apply to the service, not any other charges.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Upon addition of a new payment method or each service request, BlowOutGoOut may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the service cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or check card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. </p>
      <p>5. Payments</p>
      <p>If you are a stylist, you will receive payment for your provision of Services. All service payments are subject to a BlowOutGoOut Commission, discussed below. You will also receive any tips provided by users to you, and tips will not be subject to any BlowOutGoOut Commission. BlowOutGoOut will process all payments due to you through its third party payments processor. You acknowledge and agree that such amounts shall not include any interest and will be net of any amounts that we are required to withhold by law.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Commission</strong>. In exchange for permitting you to offer your Services through the BlowOutGoOut platform and marketplace as a independent contractor, you agree to pay BlowOutGoOut, LLC. and permit BlowOutGoOut, LLC. to retain a fee based on each transaction in which you provide services. The amount of the applicable commission will be communicated to you in a commission schedule through the stylists dashboard. BlowOutGoOut reserves the right to change the commission at any time in BlowOutGoOut’s discretion based upon local market factors, and BlowOutGoOut will provide you with notice in the event of such change. Continued use of the BlowOutGoOut platform after any such change in the commission calculation shall constitute your consent to such change.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Pricing</strong>. You expressly authorize BlowOutGoOut to set the prices on your behalf for all charges that apply to the provision of services. BlowOutGoOut reserves the right to change the service schedule at any time in our discretion based upon local market factors, and we will provide you with notice in the event of changes to the service fee.</p>
      <p> • <strong>Fee Adjustment</strong>. BlowOutGoOut reserves the right to adjust or withhold all or a portion of the fees if it believes that you have attempted to defraud or abuse BlowOutGoOut or it’s payment systems. In order to resolve a users complaint, BlowOutGoOut’s decision to adjust or withhold the fee in any way shall be exercised in a reasonable manner.</p>
      <p>6. Promotions and referral programs</p>
      <p>BlowOutGoOut, at its sole discretion, may make available promotions with different features to any users or prospective users. These promotions, unless made to you, shall have no bearing whatsoever on your agreement or relationship with BlowOutGoOut. BlowOutGoOut reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or benefits obtained through a promotion the event that BlowOutGoOut determines or believes that the redemption of the promotion or receipt of the credit or benefit was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of the applicable promotion terms or this agreement.</p>
      <p>From time to time, BlowOutGoOut may offer you with incentives to refer new users to the BlowOutGoOut community (the “Referral Program”). These incentives may come in the form of Credits, and BlowOutGoOut may set or change the incentive types, amounts, terms, restrictions, and qualification requirements for any incentives in its sole discretion.
